Basically what I decided to do to find out what the lowest common ancestor is first find out which subtree the LCA is in or if it's the root. To do this we checked whether both values were lesser or both values were greater, if one was lesser but one was greater than the root then we return that root. We simply traverse through the 
BST until we were able to find that node.
